  abstract = {Numerous studies have revealed the existence of nonrandom trait distribution patterns as a sign of environmental filtering and/or biotic interactions in a community assembly process. A number of metrics with various algorithms have been used to detect these patterns without any clear guidelines. Although some studies have compared their statistical powers, the differences in performance among the metrics under the conditions close to actual studies are not clear. Therefore, the performances of five metrics of convergence and 16 metrics of divergence under alternative conditions were comparatively analyzed using a suite of simulated communities. We focused particularly on the robustness of the performances to conditions that are often uncertain and uncontrollable in actual studies; e.g., atypical trait distribution patterns stemming from the operation of multiple assembly mechanisms, a scaling of trait-function relationships, and a sufficiency of analyzed traits. Most tested metrics, for either convergence or divergence, had sufficient statistical power to distinguish nonrandom trait distribution patterns without uncertainty. However, the performances of the metrics were considerably influenced by both atypical trait distribution patterns and other uncertainties. Influences from these uncertainties varied among the metrics of different algorithms and their performances were often complementary. Therefore, under the uncertainties of an assembly process, the selection of appropriate metrics and the combined use of complementary metrics are critically important to reliably distinguish nonrandom patterns in a trait distribution. We provide a tentative list of recommended metrics for future studies.},

  abstract = {Many attempts to restore tropical forests at deforested lands have failed, mostly because the traits of planted species were inappropriate without information on their regeneration. Thus, a new approach for determining the ability of tree species to reestablish in degraded forest land is necessary for restoration practices. We investigated plant functional traits and the factors affecting restoration success in forest communities that had been restored both by natural regeneration and enrichment plantations, in abandoned shifting-cultivation areas within the tropical montane forests of Suthep-Pui National Park Chiang Mai, northern Thailand. Five 1-ha permanent plots (100. m. \texttimes. 100. m) were established in three different forest management areas: primary forest, secondary forest, and enrichment plantations. The species composition of canopy trees, regenerated seedlings, and saplings were analyzed to determine tree functional traits and the factors governing forest composition, such as the physical environment and recruitment limitation. We found that trees within primary forest tended to have relatively heavier wood and larger seeds than secondary forest species. The dominance of certain species in primary forests was significantly correlated with wood density and seed size, although the correlations in secondary forests and enriched plantations varied among stands. The seedlings of the species with high leaf toughness, large leaf mass area, and wood density tended to be more sensitive to environmental conditions. Species with larger seeds tended to have a more limited recruitment, suggesting that enrichment plantations were more suitable for the establishment of these species. Our results suggest that the restoration of primary forest by natural regeneration is difficult because it is prevented by both environmental conditions and recruitment limitation. The contribution of these factors was species-dependent, which could be partly predicted by their functional traits. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

We investigated broad-scale patterns of vertical stratification of moths collected from extensive cross-continental fieldwork in a variety of forest types, climates, elevations, latitudes and areas with differing biogeographical history. Location Tropical and subtropical rain forest in eastern Australia; tropical, subtropical and subalpine forest in Yunnan Province, China; and tropical rain forest in Panama, Vietnam, Brunei and Papua New Guinea. Methods Night-flying moths were trapped from the upper canopy and understorey. We generated a total of 64 data sets to quantify vertical stratification of moths in terms of their species richness, using coverage-based rarefaction, and assemblage composition, using standardized hierarchical beta diversity. Based on the average temperature lapse rate, we incorporated latitudinal differences into elevation and generated `corrected' elevation for each location, and analysed its relationships with the magnitude of stratification. Results We found consistent differences between canopy and understorey assemblages at almost all rain forest locations across corrected elevational gradients. The magnitude of vertical stratification in species richness did not change with increasing corrected elevation. In contrast, the difference in assemblage composition increased with increasing corrected elevation in the Northern Hemisphere, while the opposite, albeit weak, trend was found in the Southern Hemisphere. Main conclusions Clear vertical stratification was evident in moth assemblages regardless of elevation and latitude. However, the degree to which assemblages are stratified between canopy and understorey is not uniformly related to elevation and latitude. Inconsistencies in the magnitude of vertical stratification between the Northern and Southern Hemisphere, may reflect, on one hand, deep-time biogeographical differences between the land masses studied and, on the other, place-to-place differences in resource availability underpinning the observed moth assemblages.},

Techniques to construct VCs have been developed and modified continuously, but controversies continue. We compared VCs constructed using the bench-top dehydration (BD), air-injection-flow (AI), pneumatic-air-discharge (PAD), optical (OP) and X-ray-computed microtomography (MicroCT) methods for tropical trees and lianas with contrasting vessel lengths. The PAD method generated highly vulnerable VCs, the AI method intermediate VCs, whereas the BD, OP and MicroCT methods produced comparable and more resistant VCs. Vessel-length and diameter accounted for the overestimation ratio of vulnerability estimated using the AI but not the PAD method. Compared with directly measured midday embolism levels, the PAD and AI methods substantially overestimated embolism, whereas the BD, MicroCT and OP methods provided more reasonable estimations. Cut-open vessels, uncertainties in maximum air volume estimations, sample-length effects, tissue cracks and shrinkage together may impede the reliability of the PAD method. In conclusion, we validate the BD, OP and MicroCT methods for tropical plants, whereas the PAD and AI need further mechanistic testing. Therefore, applications of VCs in estimating plant responses to drought need to be cautious.},

Plant hydraulic trait variation was partitioned substantially by leaf habit but not growth form along a trade-off axis between traits that support drought tolerance versus avoidance. Semi-deciduous species and shrubs had the highest branch dieback and top-kill (complete aboveground death) among the leaf habits or growth forms. Dieback and top-kill were well explained by combining hydraulic traits with leaf habit and growth form, suggesting integrating life history traits with hydraulic traits will yield better predictions.},

One example of nectar theft is that shown by striped-squirrels (Tamiops swinhoei) on a number of ginger species, including Alpinia roxburghii and A. kwangsiensis (Zingiberaceae). In this study, we used a fluorescent dye as a pollen analogue, and measured fruit and seed output, to test the effect of squirrel nectar-robbing on A. roxburghii reproductive fitness. Pollen transfer between robbed and unrobbed flowers was assessed by comparing 60 randomly established plots containing robbed and unrobbed flowers. The frequency of squirrel robbing visits and broken styles were recorded from a number of flowers for five consecutive days. Two bee species (Bombus eximius and Apis cerana), were the primary pollinators, and their visitation frequency was recorded for six consecutive days. The results showed that fluorescent powder from unrobbed flowers was dispersed further, and to a greater number of flowers than that placed on robbed flowers. Additionally, robbing flowers caused significant damage to reproductive organs, resulting in lower fruit and seed sets in robbed than in unrobbed flowers and influencing both male and female fitness. The frequency of the primary pollinator visits (B. eximius) was significantly higher for unrobbed plants than for robbed plants. The present study clearly shows the negative impact of squirrel robbing on A. roxburghii male reproductive fitness and neutral impact on female reproductive fitness.},

We analyzed species diversity of plant communities in~subalpine moorlands as well as underlying mechanisms using trait-based approaches to reveal that landscape-level species diversity is mainly a function of between-moorland level species diversity. Species composition and community-level functional traits were influenced by environmental factors such as temperature and soil water characteristics. We analyzed light acquisition efficiency of species belonging to different functional groups and found a seasonal niche separation for light use between functional groups, facilitating species coexistence. Furthermore, we found that species diversity in moorland plant communities conforms to a spatially nested structure. By assuming that the nested rank of species is the potential order of species loss, our simulation analysis demonstrated that vulnerability is considerably different among moorlands, which implies that functional diversity can be a useful measure for the planning of conservation strategies.},

How species survival rates change with size offers insight into the links between biodiversity and ecosystem function across tropical forests. We tested patterns of size-dependent tree survival across the tropics using data from 1,781 species and over 2 million individuals to assess whether tropical forests can be characterized by size-dependent life-history survival strategies. We found that species were classifiable into four `survival modes' that explain life-history variation that shapes carbon cycling and the relative abundance within forests. Frequently collected functional traits, such as wood density, leaf mass per area and seed mass, were not generally predictive of the survival modes of species. Mean annual temperature and cumulative water deficit predicted the proportion of biomass of survival modes, indicating important links between evolutionary strategies, climate and carbon cycling. The application of survival modes in demographic simulations predicted biomass change across forest sites. Our results reveal globally identifiable size-dependent survival strategies that differ across diverse systems in a consistent way. The abundance of survival modes and interaction with climate ultimately determine forest structure, carbon storage in biomass and future forest trajectories.},

Such changes may involve intraspecific variation and replacement by species that have different trait values. We hypothesized that they also involve the variation within and among functional groups (FGs) to the environmental dependence of trait values at the community level. We studied environmental dependence of trait values in 27 moorlands at various scales and analyzed to what extent intraspecific variation, species replacement within FGs and FG replacement contribute to the gradient of community trait values. The community structure in moorlands was influenced mainly by two environmental factors: temperature and water condition. Plants inhabiting sites with low temperature and low-pH generally tended to have lower maximum leaf height, greater leaf mass per area, and smaller leaf size. At the community level, site-mean of maximum leaf height and leaf size generally increased with increasing temperature and water pH. Our analysis demonstrated that the relative contributions of intraspecific variation, species replacement within FGs and FG replacement differed depending on combinations of the traits and environments. The contribution of FG replacement varied considerably among cases (0.6\textendash 34.5~\%). Species replacement within FGs, which has received little attention in previous studies, was most responsible for the community-level changes (31.6\textendash 65.3~\%) and intraspecific variation also made a large contribution (22.9\textendash 57.9~\%). Understanding such various mechanisms involving intraspecific variation and species replacement should help us better predict how the structure and functioning of moorland plant communities will respond to climate change.},

  abstract = {1. Habitat filtering and limiting similarity have been proposed as two opposing forces structuring community memberships. Community assembly theory proposes habitat filtering as a mechanism restricting community membership according to the ecological strategies of species in a given environment. Limiting similarity posits that some species exclude others that are ecologically similar. 2. We quantified nine ecophysiological and life-history traits for 80 dipterocarp species in the 52-ha Lambir Forest Dynamics Plot (FDP; Lambir Hills National Park, Sarawak, Malaysia). We studied forests on four soil types differing in fertility and moisture, focusing on soil resource availabilities as environmental determinants of habitat filtering processes. We used a null-model approach to detect the strengths of habitat filtering and limiting similarity. We quantified the relative contributions of soil resources (nutrients and water) to habitat filtering by comparing the strength of habitat filtering processes (i.e. effect sizes) at the overall plot scale and at the individual soil-type scale. We also compared the strengths of assembly processes among soil types. 3. Compared to a null model at microscale (20 {$\cdot$} 20 m), trait range and variance were reduced for seven of nine functional traits, suggesting the importance of habitat filtering in the dipterocarp community. We also found a broader distribution of five traits, and more even spacing for seven traits (20 {$\cdot$} 20 m), which is consistent with the concept of limiting similarity. Randomizations that swapped species occurrences within soil types (i.e. null models removing soil effects in assembly processes) were much closer to observed values, and there were no phylogenetic constraints on habitat association. Hence, soil resource availability acted as a habitat filtering mechanismin the FDP; relative contributions to habitat filtering ranged from 35\% for seed mass to 77\% for relative growth rate. Furthermore, soil types apparently affected the strengths of habitat filtering and limiting similarity. 4. Synthesis. We demonstrate that soil resource availability is a crucial determinant of habitat filtering in this species-rich tropical rain forest; the strengths of assembly processes differed among soil types. Variation in soil resource availability can shape the distribution of traits through community assembly processes, promoting trait diversification and species coexistence.

This paper introduces a new R package, LeafArea, which allows one to conveniently run ImageJ (http:/\slash imagej.\hspace{0pt}nih.\hspace{0pt}gov\slash ij\slash ) within R. The functions in this package analyze multiple scanned leaf images in the target directory, generate multiple output files containing the leaf area of each leaf image, and then process and combine these files into a single file in a format that is convenient for subsequent analyses. Leaf area data from multiple images from the same sample can be combined automatically. This function allows users to cut large leaves into several pieces during scanning. The package provides a user-friendly, automated tool for measuring leaf area from scanned images.},

There is, however, no consensus regarding the choice of analytical methods. We contrast species- and community-level analyses of change in the functional composition for four traits related to drought tolerance using three decades of repeat censuses of trees in the 50-ha Forest Dynamics Plot on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Community trait distributions shifted significantly through time, which may indicate a shift toward more drought tolerant species. However, at the species level, changes in abundance were unrelated to trait values. To reconcile these seemingly contrasting results, we evaluated species-specific contributions to the directional shifts observed at the community level. Abundance changes of just one to six of 312 species were responsible for the community-level shifts observed for each trait. Our results demonstrate that directional changes in community-level functional composition can result from idiosyncratic change in a few species rather than widespread community-wide changes associated with functional traits. Future analyses of directional change in natural communities should combine community-, species-, and possibly individual-level analyses to uncover relationships with function that can improve understanding and enable prediction.},

Methods: Commercial D-dimer assays, evaluated according to predetermined cutoff levels for each assay, specific for age (lower in subjects {$<$}70 years) and gender (lower in males), were used in the recent DULCIS study. The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged {$\geq$}60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event. Conclusion: The results confirm the usefulness of the cutoff levels used in DULCIS.},

  abstract = {Premise Leaf mass per area (LMA), which is an important functional trait in leaf economic spectrum and plant growth analysis, is measured from leaf discs or whole leaves. Differences between the measurement methods may lead to large differences in the estimates of LMA values. Methods We examined to what extent estimates of LMA based on whole leaves match those based on discs using 334 woody species from a wide range of biomes (tropics, subtropics, savanna, and temperate), whether the relationship varied by leaf morphology (tissue density, leaf area, leaf thickness), punch size (0.6- and 1.0-cm diameter), and whether the extent of intraspecifc variation for each species matches. Results Disc-based estimates of species mean LMA matched the whole-leaf estimates well, and whole-leaf LMA tended to be 9.69\% higher than leaf-disc LMA. The ratio of whole-leaf LMA to leaf-disc LMA was higher for species with higher leaf tissue density and larger leaves, and variance in the ratio was greater for species with lower leaf tissue density and thinner leaves. Estimates based on small leaf discs also inflated the ratio. The extent of the intraspecific variation only weakly matched between whole-leaf and disc-based estimates (R2 = 0.08). Conclusions Our results suggest that simple conversion between whole-leaf and leaf-disc LMA is difficult for species obtained with a small leaf punch, but it should be possible for species obtained with a large+ leaf punch. Accurately representing leaf traits will likely require careful selection between leaf-disc and whole-leaf traits depending on the objectives. Quantifying intraspecific variation using leaf discs should be also considered with caution.},

  abstract = {Aim Recent progress in island biogeography indicates that classical island biogeography alone cannot encapsulate the complex and dynamic nature of island biogeographical processes. Factors such as habitat complexity and connectivity, and in the face of the Anthropocene, human disturbance and invasive species, may influence insular communities. The relative importance of these factors, however, may differ among groups of biota. Here we employed an information theoretic approach to investigate factors likely to explain patterns in species richness and assemblage composition of five different groups of arthropods (ants, beetles, flies, spiders and cockroaches) and native and exotic plants within an insular community. Location Capricornia Cays located at the southern end of Great Barrier Reef, eastern Australia. Methods Arthropods were sampled from 14 cays using pitfall and Malaise traps and hand collecting. Plants were comprehensively surveyed on each island. We used univariate and multivariate generalized linear models with a model averaging technique, to calculate summed Akaike weights which quantified the relative importance of predictor variables in explaining variation in species richness and assemblage composition. Results We found that infestation of the invasive ant Pheidole megacephala was negatively correlated with the species richness of ants, beetles and flies. Unlike species richness, only the assemblage composition of ants was related to P. megacephala infestation. Assemblage composition of other arthropod groups and plants was related to various factors, including island size (native plants), native plant species richness (beetles, flies and spiders) and presence of human disturbances (exotic plants and cockroaches). Main conclusions The information theoretic approach proved useful in determining the relative likelihood of factors influencing both univariate and multivariate data of insular fauna and flora. The results demonstrated that human disturbance and proliferation of invasive species can override other biogeographical processes. The relative importance of these factors, however, varied depending on the taxonomic groups studied.},

Consequently, various taxa (or species) have been proposed as indicators for inclusion within long-term monitoring programmes to quantify the ecological impacts of future climatic change. Ideal indicators should be restricted to a particular elevational range (i.e. have high specificity) and be readily detectable across space and time (i.e. have high fidelity). This, however, has not been rigorously tested for elevational studies. We employed a spatially and temporally replicated sampling design to test the utility of tree, ant, and canopy and understorey moth species as indicators of elevation within continuous subtropical rainforest of eastern Australia. Using the classical indicator value protocol, we tested (i) whether the number of indicator species (all taxa) found in the observed data was significantly greater than the number obtained by chance; (ii) whether the indicator species (ants and moths) identified from one sampling season responded to elevation in a similar way in samples obtained from other seasons; and (iii) whether the indicator species (ants) identified from one elevational transect responded to elevation in a similar way in a nearby transect that incorporated similar elevational ranges. All groups had significantly greater numbers of indicator species than expected by chance. Temporal fidelity of moth indicator species was lower than that of ants as the suite of moth indicator species showed high seasonal variation. In contrast, ants showed high spatial and temporal fidelity. Most ant indicator species were, however, indicative of low and mid-elevations, and only one species was indicative of the highest elevation, suggesting their relatively low conservation significance in relation to climate warming in this region. It is essential that we understand how spatial and temporal variation affects the distributions of different taxonomic groups when incorporating multiple taxa for long-term monitoring programmes.},

  abstract = {Understanding variation in leaf functional traits-including rates of photosynthesis and respiration and concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus-is a fundamental challenge in plant ecophysiology. When expressed per unit leaf area, these traits typically increase with leaf mass per area (LMA) within species but are roughly independent of LMA across the global flora. LMA is determined by mass components with different biological functions, including photosynthetic mass that largely determines metabolic rates and contains most nitrogen and phosphorus, and structural mass that affects toughness and leaf lifespan (LL). A possible explanation for the contrasting trait relationships is that most LMA variation within species is associated with variation in photosynthetic mass, whereas most LMA variation across the global flora is associated with variation in structural mass. This hypothesis leads to the predictions that (i) gas exchange rates and nutrient concentrations per unit leaf area should increase strongly with LMA across species assemblages with low LL variance but should increase weakly with LMA across species assemblages with high LL variance and that (ii) controlling for LL variation should increase the strength of the above LMA relationships. We present analyses of intra- and interspecific trait variation from three tropical forest sites and interspecific analyses within functional groups in a global dataset that are consistent with the above predictions. Our analysis suggests that the qualitatively different trait relationships exhibited by different leaf assemblages can be understood by considering the degree to which photosynthetic and structural mass components contribute to LMA variation in a given assemblage.},

  abstract = {Communities in isolated habitat patches surrounded by inhospitable matrices often form a nested subset pattern. However, the underlying causal mechanisms and conservation implications of nestedness in regional communities remain controversial. The nested ranks of species in a nested species-by-site matrix may reflect a gradient of species vulnerability to extinction or of colonization ability. However, nestedness analysis has rarely been used to explore determinants of species rank; consequently, little is known of underpinning mechanisms. In this study, we examined nestedness in moorland plant communities widely interspersed within the subalpine zone of northern Japan. Moorland sites differed in area (1000160 000 m2) and were naturally isolated from one another to various extents within an inhospitable forest matrix. We also determined whether site characteristics (physical and morphometric measures) and species characteristics (niche position and breadth, based on species traits) are related to nestedness. Moorland plant communities in the study area were significantly nested. The pH and moorland kernel density (proxy for spatial clustering of moorlands around the focal site) were the most important predictors of moorland site nested rank in a nestedness matrix. Niche breadths of species (measured as variation in leaf mass area and height) predicted species nested ranks. Selective environmental tolerances imposed by environmental harshness and selective extinction caused by declines in site carrying capacities probably account for the nested subset pattern in moorland plant communities. The nested rank of species in the nestedness matrix can therefore be translated into the potential order of species loss explainable by species niche breadths (based on variation in functional traits). Complementary understanding of the determinants of site ranking and species ranking in the nestedness matrix provides powerful insight into ecological processes underlying nestedness and into the ways by which communities are assembled or disassembled by such processes.},

However, a paucity of quantitative data strongly limits such attempts. In this study, we used an additive diversity partitioning framework and quantified diversity patterns of moorland plant communities across hierarchical spatial scales, within- and between-sample transects, and between sites (corresponding to {$\alpha$} and two levels of {$\beta$} diversity). Moorland sites markedly differed in size (range 1,000\textendash 160,000~m2) and were isolated from each other to varying extents within an inhospitable matrix (i.e., forests). We found that {$\beta$} diversity components were consistently higher, whereas the local {$\alpha$} diversity component was consistently lower than expected by chance. We observed substantial contribution at the between-site scale to total species richness. By focusing on diversity patterns of moorland plant communities across multiple hierarchical spatial scales, we could thus identify the scale at which regional diversity is maximized. Our results suggest that protection of as many moorland sites as possible, to ensure beta diversity between sites, will effectively conserve total diversity. The use of additive diversity partitioning is a major step forward in providing strategies for the biological conservation of subalpine moorland ecosystems vulnerable to future environmental changes.},

  abstract = {Understanding the consequences of realistic species loss on the functioning and persistence of vulnerable ecosystems is key to devising conservation strategies when environmental changes are immediate threats. Yet, few studies have provided direct evidence for conservation prioritization and decision-making. We incorporated the quantification of functional diversity based on the Rao index of diversity (FDrao) into this applied context and examined the consequences of realistic species loss on functional diversity in moorland plant communities widely interspersed within a subalpine zone in northern Japan. The realistic order of species loss was derived from the nested subset pattern in the moorland communities, which was corroborated by selective species tolerance and selective extinction. We analysed the relationships between the FDrao half-life, as an index of each moorland's vulnerability to species loss, and a range of environmental variables describing the moorlands. We then mapped this index across the entire landscape. At most sites, ordered species loss caused a relatively small decline in FDrao until a certain number of species was lost and an accelerating decline thereafter, suggesting relatively low initial vulnerability to species loss. At the other sites, however, ordered species loss caused an approximately proportional decrease in FDrao, suggesting relatively high vulnerability to species loss. The model indicated that sites with higher elevation, higher carrying capacities, or increasing isolation have a shorter FDrao half-life. The mapping of this index allowed us to identify the geographical distribution of sites of high conservation priority. Synthesis and applications. We performed fine-scale assessments of the vulnerability of moorland plant communities to species loss, which is likely to occur under future environmental conditions, by simulating the consequences of realistic species loss for functional diversity. The methods used here can provide urgently needed information to support the prioritization and decision-making involved in conserving ecosystems in the face of global biodiversity loss. \textcopyright{} 2013 The Authors.},

Overall, ITV accounted for 25\% of the total trait variation within communities and 32\% of the total trait variation among communities on average. The relative extent of ITV tended to be greater for whole-plant (e.g. plant height) vs. organ-level traits and for leaf chemical (e.g. leaf N and P concentration) vs. leaf morphological (e.g. leaf area and thickness) traits. The relative amount of ITV decreased with increasing species richness and spatial extent, but did not vary with plant growth form or climate. These results highlight global patterns in the relative importance of ITV in plant communities, providing practical guidelines for when researchers should include ITV in trait-based community and ecosystem studies.},

  abstract = {The relationship between {$\beta$}-diversity and latitude still remains to be a core question in ecology because of the lack of consensus between studies. One hypothesis for the lack of consensus between studies is that spatial scale changes the relationship between latitude and {$\beta$}-diversity. Here, we test this hypothesis using tree data from 15 large-scale forest plots (greater than or equal to 15 ha, diameter at breast height {$\geq$} 1 cm) across a latitudinal gradient (3\textendash 30o) in the Asia-Pacific region. We found that the observed {$\beta$}-diversity decreased with increasing latitude when sampling local tree communities at small spatial scale (grain size {$\leq$}0.1 ha), but the observed {$\beta$}-diversity did not change with latitude when sampling at large spatial scales (greater than or equal to 0.25 ha). Differences in latitudinal {$\beta$}-diversity gradients across spatial scales were caused by pooled species richness ({$\gamma$}-diversity), which influenced observed {$\beta$}-diversity values at small spatial scales, but not at large spatial scales. Therefore, spatial scale changes the relationship between {$\beta$}-diversity, {$\gamma$}-diversity and latitude, and improving sample representativeness avoids the {$\gamma$}-dependence of {$\beta$}-diversity.},

  abstract = {Over the past three decades, there has been a concerted effort to study the long-term dynamics of tropical forests throughout the world. Data regarding temporal trends in species diversity, species composition, and species-specific demographic rates have now been amassed. Such data can be utilized to test predictions regarding the roles the environment and demographic stochasticity play in driving forest dynamics. These analyses could be further refined by quantifying the temporal trends in the functional composition and diversity in tropical forests. For example, we have only a handful of studies that quantify directional shifts in the functional composition in tropical forests in response to global change drivers. The present study uses data from three censuses spanning 30 yr in a Neotropical dry forest dynamics plot to provide novel insights into how the functional diversity and composition of a tropical forest has changed through time. Specifically, here we aim to (1) quantify population dynamics and compare it to that expected from environmental or demographic variance; (2) quantify long-term trends in species richness and functional diversity; (3) test whether there have been directional changes in the functional composition of the forest though time and the population changes that are responsible for these changes; and (4) place these long-term results into the context of the successional and climatic history of the forest.},
